Projects completed during the Data Science course at Yandex.Praktikum.

## Projects:

### 1. ML model prototype for an industrial production

**Description of the project:** The goal of the project is to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for an industrial production, which will help optimize production in order to avoid launching a enterprise with unprofitable characteristics. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from a gold ore. 

**Result:** The prototype is prepared and checked on a test sample using the sMAPE quality metric. Compared with a constant model.

**Tools and techniques:** Pandas, scikit-learn, Numpy, CatBoost, Matplotlib, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, model exploration, Bootstrap, cross-validation, feature scaling

**Project status:** Completed



### 2. Comments classification model for an online store

**Description of the project:** An online store is launching a new service. Users can now edit and add product descriptions just like in wiki-community.
The goal is to create a tool that searches for toxic comments and submit them for moderation. We'll train the model to classify comments into positive and negative. 

The value of the quality metric F1 for the model must be at least 0.75.

**Result:** The model was built and trained. The value of the metric F1 has reached the required value. Feature engineering is applied to texts and time series.
Texts were vectorized using word2vec.

**Tools and techniques:** Pandas, sklearn, numpy, NLTK, LightGBM, CatBoost, ML, cross-validation, stemming, feature engineering, word2vec, R

**Project status:** Completed



### 3. Car price prediction

**Description of the project:** Used car sales service is developing an application to attract new customers. It will help to find out the market price of a car.

**Result:** Analyzed the data: technical characteristics, configuration and car prices. Built a model in order to determine the cost of a used car.
Used the following: numerical methods, approximate calculations, algorithm complexity estimation, gradient descent.

**Tools and techniques:** Pandas, sklearn, numpy, LightGBM, CatBoost, ML

**Project status:** Completed
