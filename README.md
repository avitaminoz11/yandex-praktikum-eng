## Projects:

### 1. ML model prototype for an industrial production

**Description of the project:** The goal of the project is to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for an industrial production, which will help optimize production in order to avoid launching a enterprise with unprofitable characteristics. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from a gold ore. 

**Result:** The prototype is prepared and checked on a test sample using the sMAPE quality metric. Compared with a constant model.

**Tools and techniques:** Pandas, scikit-learn, Numpy, CatBoost, Matplotlib, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, model exploration, Bootstrap, cross-validation, feature scaling

**Project status:** Completed
