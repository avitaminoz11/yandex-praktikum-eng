### Studying the patterns that determine the success of a game

**Description of the project:** An online store sells computer games all over the world. Historical data of games sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms are available from open sources.

**Result:** The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions are revealed. Potentially popular product identified and advertising campaigns planned. Portraits of users of each region were compiled. Hypotheses tested: average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. Used Student's t-test for independent samples during the analysis. 

**Tools and techniques:** Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, data preprocessing, statistical hypothesis testing

**Project status:** Completed
